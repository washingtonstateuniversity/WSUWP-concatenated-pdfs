WSUWP-concatenated-pdfs
=======================

Still in dev so the repo it dirty. Don't count on things till a tag is put forth. 

The goal of this plugin is to provide the ability to collate a site into a pdf.  Some of the key points this project is aiming to hit are:

1. Allow for filtering of posts taxonomy and metadata
1. Provide a way to design the PDF
1. More to come
